Q: What if I don't know the value of a project?
A: Project value is a required field, and a numeric value must be provided (i.e. $15,000,000, not "$15 million" or "between $10 and $15 million".  However in some cases no value is provided by the project designer.  Posts should work with the organizations proposing the project to identify an estimated value, or to look at similar projects in the region.  You can also reach out to potential bidders and firms in the sector for their rough estimates.  Provide your best guess as to the project value based on this input, and then in the Post Comments section you may note that the project value is only an estimate.

Q: What do I look for when determining whether a tender is worth entering into BIDS?
A: We have to rely on posts to determine what projects to enter into the system – you have the best sense of what’s going on in the market and what may be of strategic importance to the U.S.  Here are some criteria to consider: 
Is this a sector that is open to U.S. bidders?
Does the local government want U.S. bidders?
Have U.S. firms expressed interest or competed successfully in this sector before?
Does the U.S. government have an interest in seeing more U.S. involvement in this sector?
If a U.S. firm was seeking this contract, would the U.S. government be prepared to advocate for that firm?
Is this truly a competitive tender, or does a local or another firm already have this deal in the bag?
Am I inviting a U.S. firm to enter a bureaucratic and legal morass by encouraging them to bid on this deal?
Will a U.S. firm be truly competitive (on the basis of cost, quality, etc.) in this bid?
