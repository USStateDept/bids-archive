Q -- What if I don't know the value of a project?
A -- Project value is a required field, and a numeric value must be provided (i.e. $15,000,000, not "$15 million" or "between $10 and $15 million".  However in some cases no value is provided by the project designer.  Posts should work with the organizations proposing the project to identify an estimated value, or to look at similar projects in the region.  You can also reach out to potential bidders and firms in the sector for their rough estimates.  Provide your best guess as to the project value based on this input, and then in the Post Comments section you may note that the project value is only an estimate.
