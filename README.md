# Summary
This project is the brainchild of the Economics Bureau and the Office of eDiplomacy at the US Department of State. Basically, we're taking what used to be a monthly memo about projects around the world currently in the pipeline, and mapping them. The added value from State is trade leads from posts.

This project is in its infancy but its going somewhere good.

We'll be releasing the URL to the site once we go live sometime later this year.

# Tech Details
* We're using the [OpenGeo suite](http://opengeo.org/) to make the map interface
* The webpage itself is all the javascript we put here on [this git](https://github.com/USStateDept/bids)

# More info
* Check the [wiki](https://github.com/USStateDept/bids/wiki) for more information, or just dive into the code
* [Contact us via email](mailto:BIDS-Mailbox@state.gov) if you've got project related questions
